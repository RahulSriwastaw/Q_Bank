6. Adds internal choice questions
7. Generates marking scheme
8. Formats as per board pattern
9. Preview before finalizing
```

**Output:**
```
Generated deliverables:
- Question Paper (PDF/Word)
- Blank Answer Sheet template
- Marking Scheme
- Answer Key
- Model Answers
- OMR Sheet (for MCQ section)
- Teacher Instructions

Additional:

2. Zoom from 10% to 500% using mouse wheel
3. Pan with middle mouse button or Space + drag
4. Responsive to window resize
5. Render all canvas objects from Zustand store
6. Handle touch gestures for mobile (pinch to zoom, two-finger pan)
7. Show minimap in bottom-right corner
8. Grid system (optional, toggleable)
9. Performance optimization for 1000+ objects (virtualization)

State Management:

- Handle viewport (x, y, zoom)
- Manage all canvas objects

Key Functions:
- handleWheel (for zoom)
- handleDrag (for pan)
- handleObjectDrag (for moving objects)
- fitToScreen()

Performance:
- Use React.memo for object components
- Implement viewport culling (only render visible objects)
- Debounce zoom/pan events
```

**Expected Component Structure:**
```typescript
const InfiniteCanvas = () => {
  const { objects, viewport, updateViewport } = useCanvasStore();
  const stageRef = useRef<Konva.Stage>(null);
  
  // Zoom handler
  const handleWheel = (e: KonvaEventObject<WheelEvent>) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  // Pan handler
  const handleDragEnd = (e: KonvaEventObject<DragEvent>) => {
    // Implementation
  };
  
  return (
    <Stage
      ref={stageRef}
      width={window.innerWidth}
      height={window.innerHeight}
      onWheel={handleWheel}
      draggable
      onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
    >
      <Layer>
        {/* Grid */}
        {/* Canvas Objects */}
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};
```

### 1.4 Zustand Store Setup

**File: `src/store/canvasStore.ts`**

**AI Prompt:**
```
Create a Zustand store for managing canvas state with these features:

State:
- objects: CanvasObject[]
- selectedIds: string[]
- viewport: { x, y, zoom }
- gridEnabled: boolean
- history: for undo/redo (max 50 steps)

Actions:
- addObject(object: CanvasObject)
- updateObject(id: string, updates: Partial<CanvasObject>)
- deleteObject(id: string)
- deleteSelected()
- selectObjects(ids: string[])
- clearSelection()
- updateViewport(viewport: Partial<Viewport>)
- groupObjects(ids: string[])
- ungroupObjects(groupId: string)
- undo()
- redo()
- duplicateSelected()
- bringToFront(id: string)
- sendToBack(id: string)

Include middleware for:
- Persistence (localStorage)
- History tracking (for undo/redo)
